# Now we will program a hero program together
# Hero has activities to do to choose from 
# Hero has some stats - hp, power, money etc.
# Each activity should somehow change the stats (decrease or increase)

# TIP: the game should involve some randomness in order to be fun (usually what is unexpected is fun)

# What is the goal of the game?

# TODO: Create variables for hero stats

# TODO: Create code that shows what is the current state of the hero (how much hp, money etc we have)

# TODO: Create activities and write a list of them to the player

# TODO: When player enters id of an activity, do something to the player stats
